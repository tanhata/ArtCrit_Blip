Art Critique Project: Fine-tuning BLIP with Wiki Van Gogh Dataset
Overview

This project leverages BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pre-training) to create a fine-tuned model capable of generating art critiques for images of artworks, specifically using Van Gogh's paintings sourced from the WikiArt dataset. By fine-tuning BLIP with these images and their corresponding descriptions or critical analyses, the model learns to provide insightful and stylistically relevant critiques for other artworks.
Features

    Fine-tuned BLIP model: Enhanced to understand and critique Van Gogh’s works and their stylistic nuances.
    Art critique generation: Automatically produces descriptive and analytical feedback for given art pieces.
    Custom dataset support: Extendable to other artists or collections.
    Easy-to-use interface: Input an image and get a detailed critique.

Dataset

The project uses a dataset of Van Gogh’s artworks from WikiArt. Each image is paired with textual descriptions, including:

    Title and creation year
    Stylistic analysis (e.g., brushwork, color theory, composition)
    Historical and contextual significance
